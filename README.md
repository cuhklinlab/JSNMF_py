# JSNMF
JSNMF: Joint analysis of scRNA-seq and epigenomic-seq data via semi-orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization

This is the Python implementation of the JSNMF algorithm. Note that this implementation can employ GPU to speed up the code, just 
simply submit the script to the GPU clusters is okay.

## 1. Installation
You can use the following command to install JSNMF:
```
pip3 install JSNMF
```

## 2. Example

You can refer to [here](https://github.com/ZexuanSun/JSNMF/blob/main/Example/demo_jsnmf.ipynb) for a simple illustration of the use of JSNMF.
